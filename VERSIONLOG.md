* It seems to be loading really slowly on the page. Like 20-30 seconds sometimes, if it even loads.  This is with the production extension removed so only the new version is installed as an unpackedextension.

* Syndications tiles should open to take up the whole sidebar. The slider should not be visible when the comment view is engaged, nor should syndication or voices counts.

* When I click on a syndication tile, it doe not expand to show the full comment. It leaves the
original syndication truncated.

* The side to side chevrons need to be adjusted slightly. Specifcally they need to be a hair
thinner, spread apart by a few pixels and raised a few pixels so their center line is aligned with
the back and conversation text.

syndication icon from that spot, but never expanded the reply feld to fll that space.
